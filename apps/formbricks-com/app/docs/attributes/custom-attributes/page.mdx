#### Attributes

# Setting attributes with code

One way to send attributes to Formbricks is in your code. In Formbricks, there are two special attributes for [user identification](/docs/attributes/identify-users)(user ID & email) and custom attributes. An example:

## Setting during Initialization

It's recommended to set custom user attributes directly during the initialization of Formbricks for better user identification.

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Set custom attributes during initialization">

```javascript
formbricks.init({
  environmentId: "<environment-id>",
  apiHost: "<api-host>",
  userId: "<user_id>",
  attributes: {
    plan: "free",
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

## Setting independently

You can use the setAttribute function to set any custom attribute for the user (e.g. name, plan, etc.) anywhere in the user journey. Formbricks maintains a state of the current user inside the browser and makes sure attributes aren't sent to the backend twice.

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Setting Plan to Pro">

```javascript
formbricks.setAttribute("Plan", "Pro");
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
Generally speaking, the setAttribute function works like this:
<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Setting Custom Attributes">

```javascript
formbricks.setAttribute("attribute_key", "attribute_value");
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>
Where `attributeName` is the name of the attribute you want to set, and `attributeValue` is the value of the attribute you want to set.
