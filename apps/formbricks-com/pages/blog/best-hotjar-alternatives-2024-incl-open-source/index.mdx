Smartlook has also received numerous awards and recognition, including the G2 Crowd Awards for **Top 100 Software Products** and **Best Products for Marketers**, as well as being named on Deloitteâ€™s Technology Fast 50 in Central Europe.

Below is an overview of how Smartlook compares with HotJar.

**Features**:

- **Surveys**: Both platforms include survey features, but Smartlook does not offer standalone surveys, unlike HotJar.

- **Heatmaps & Recordings**: They both offer heatmap and recording features. Although Smartlook provides a more comprehensive insight into recordings by combining them with funnel analysis, this will help you pinpoint the exact recordings you need.
- **Integrations:** Both platforms work well with many external tools. However, if you're a big enterprise seeking a broader selection of tools, HotJar is the better choice.

**Pricing**: Compared to HotJar, Smartlook is relatively more expensive. Its pro plan provides only 30 heatmaps a month and three months of storage. HotJarâ€™s equivalent business plan offers unlimited heatmaps with 12 months of data storage.

**Privacy and Compliance:** Smartlook stores all data on EU servers. If you collect personal data with Smartlook, GDPR applies. Smartlook is also fully CCPA-compliant.

Its features include **surveys**, **session recordings**, **live view,** and **conversion funnels**. These features move beyond vanity metrics, aiming to uncover the reasons behind visitors' actions on your website.

They include **multiple-choice**, **like-or-dislike**, **rating**, and **open-ended** surveys. You can also customize how your survey is triggered based on your usersâ€™ location on your website and their devices, or if you want a delay before your survey is triggered.
- **Heatmaps & Recordings:** Both Lucky Orange and HotJar offer session recordings; however, while this feature is on par with HotJarâ€™s features like filtering, some users still report that the [session viewer crashes when watching a desktop session on the mobile screen](https://www.g2.com/products/lucky-orange/reviews/lucky-orange-review-7862805).
- **Integrations**: Lucky Orange offers a smaller but growing selection of integrations compared to HotJar, focusing on essentials like Google Analytics, CMS platforms, and marketing automation tools.

**Privacy & Compliance:** Lucky Orange tools, like HotJar, are fully CCPA and GDPR-compliant. This means that it does not store sensitive information, ensuring a secure and trustworthy environment for user data.

FullStory is a comprehensive user experience analytics platform that enables businesses to gain detailed insights into user interactions with their websites and applications. Through features such as session recordings, dynamic heatmaps, and advanced analytics, FullStory provides a nuanced understanding of user behavior.

Letâ€™s see how FullStory compares to HotJar in terms of the factors we mentioned earlier:

**Features:**

- **Surveys:** Both FullStory and HotJar offer survey features, with FullStory utilizing integration with third-party tools like Survicate and SurveyMonkey for versatility and in-depth feedback.

FullStory wins here if you are looking for a versatile tool to integrate with other existing third-party survey tools. However, if you want an all-in-one solution, HotJar is your go-to solution.

- **Heatmaps & Recordings:** FullStory's interactive heatmaps and detailed visuals help you better understand how users interact with your website, improving the analysis of page activities. This feature is similar to what HotJar offers.

However, a notable difference is that in FullStory, you can't save a session to watch later. So, if you find a recording interesting and want to see it again, you'll need to search for it manually when you want to revisit it.

- **Integrations:** Like HotJar, FullStory integrates seamlessly with various third-party tools, enhancing its versatility and allowing users to integrate it into their existing tech stack.

**Pricing:** FullStory does not have a free plan, and the price for paid plans is available upon request from the sales team. Although their pricing page states that you get a 14-day free trial for their business plan.

**Privacy & Compliance:** You are in full control of what data FullStory captures and saves. FullStory is not just GDPR and CCPA-compliant but also holds a SOC 2 Type II attestation and a SOC 3 report.

**Extensibility:** FullStory also provides several APIs, like HotJar, including a Webhooks API that enables developers to build on top of its functionality and integrate it into their workflows. However, they might not provide the level of control and flexibility required for more complex integrations or custom workflows.

Hereâ€™s how FullStory and HotJar compare side by side:

  className="w-full rounded-lg"

Mouseflow is a web analytics tool designed to provide insights into user behavior on websites. It offers features such as session recordings, heatmaps, surveys, and funnel analysis to help businesses optimize user experiences and conversions.

**Feature depth**

- **Surveys**: Mouseflow provides you with a funnel-like analysis for in-depth form analytics, which is not available on HotJar. With Mouseflow, you can replay sessions from visitors who dropped out or succeeded in completing the form. It also helps you analyze how users interact with each of your form fields.
- **Heatmaps & Recordings:** Mouseflow, like Hojar, provides heatmaps and session recordings to visualize user interactions and behaviors, aiding in the analysis of website engagement.

However, HotJar samples the data you collect daily. That is, you are allowed to review just a small fraction of the whole set of data you receive daily. For example, if you have 3000 recordings per month, you are allowed to record just 100 daily sessions on standard plans.

- **Integrations:** Mouseflow, like HotJar, integrates with about 58 third-party tools, including other analytics, eCommerce, CMS, and marketing platforms in your stack.

**Pricing**: Mouseflow's pricing is tiered based on usage and additional features. It offers a range of plans to accommodate businesses of different sizes.

Its free plan comes with 500 recordings per month, unlimited page views, and a month of storage, all for one website. Paid plans begin at $31/month, however, if you are an enterprise, you can contact their sales team to create a customized plan.

**Privacy & Compliance:** Mouseflow is committed to data protection. Itâ€™s compliant with GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, and VCDPA.

**Extensibility:** Like HotJar, Mouseflow's API and Webhooks enable developers to build custom integrations, connecting them to virtually any platform or tool imaginable. However, they might not provide the level of control and flexibility required for more complex integrations or custom workflows.

| Factors                | Mouseflow | HotJar |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| Surveys & Forms        | ðŸŸ¢        | ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢   |
| Heatmaps & Recordings  | ðŸŸ¢        | ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢   |
| Integrations           | ðŸŸ¢        | ðŸŸ¢     |
| Pricing                | ðŸŸ¢        | ðŸŸ¢     |
| Privacy and compliance | ðŸŸ¢        | ðŸŸ¢     |
| Extensibility          | ðŸŸ¡        | ðŸŸ¡     |

## So, which option is the better fit for you?

If you're seeking a comprehensive solution encompassing heatmaps, recordings, surveys, and a strong focus on privacy, MouseFlow emerges as a prime choice.

On the other hand, if your primary emphasis is on highly targeted surveys, [Formbricks](http://www.formbricks.com/) stands out as the optimal solution.

What's even more noteworthy is that it is the sole open-source solution for website surveys available. This translates to not just being completely free to use if you self-host, but also offering the freedom for modification due to its extensibility and the liberty to seamlessly integrate with your preferred tools.
